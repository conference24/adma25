# Data Science: Foundations and Applications
Special Session on Data Science: Foundations and Applications at ADMA2025

## Background

Data science has evolved into a powerful interdisciplinary field, combining principles from statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract actionable insights from data. Its applications span a wide range of industries, including healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and social sciences. Despite significant advances, many challenges remain in ensuring that data-driven solutions are not only effective but also ethical, explainable, and generalizable across diverse contexts. This special session aims to explore both foundational aspects of data science, such as data representation, algorithmic fairness, and model interpretability, as well as cutting-edge applications in real-world scenarios. By bringing together experts in both theory and practice, we seek to address key issues that influence the future of data science, ultimately advancing its application to solve real-world problems.

## Scope

The "Data Science: Foundations and Applications" session invites contributions that bridge the gap between foundational theories and practical implementations of data science. We encourage the submission of papers that focus on innovative algorithms, novel data representations, and emerging applications of data science in various domains. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Data science applications in healthcare, finance, marketing, and social sciences
- Machine learning and deep learning for complex data
- Data preprocessing and feature selection
- Core theories and algorithms
- Explaining and interpreting models
- Data-driven decisions
- Scalable algorithms for large datasets
- Transfer learning and adapting models to new domains
- Reinforcement learning and its real-world uses
- Human-computer interaction
- Data privacy and security in big data contexts

By providing a platform for discussing both theoretical advancements and real-world applications, this session aims to foster a deeper understanding of how data science can be leveraged to address critical challenges across diverse sectors.
